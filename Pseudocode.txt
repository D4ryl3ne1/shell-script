Pseudocode for the Java Compiling Script:

1. Prompt the user for a file name.
2. Check if the file exists, if the file exists, then extract the file.
3. After extracting, we want to find every .java file. We're under the assumption that the .zip file is properly exported from Eclipse.
4. Find every .java file, which should only be located in the src folder.
5. Compile every Java file.
6. We need to execute Java files ONLY if they have a main method. So search each file and check if it has 'void main' in it.
7. If the .java file has 'void main', then we know that's the main method, so we can execute that java file.
8. We should be able to execute the java file from it's directory without needing to move the file anywhere. This was a problem earlier because some files rely on importing classes from packages.
